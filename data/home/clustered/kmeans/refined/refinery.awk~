# This is an overall refinement algorithm, designed to:
# Take a full, clustered dataset and return 5 training sets and 5 test sets

# Steps:
# 1. Read clustered set into an array || 2. Modify/Remove attributes of the set (use,day,time) || 3. Split total into 6 weeks || 4. Build Training set for 1-5 
# 5. Build Test set for 2-6
